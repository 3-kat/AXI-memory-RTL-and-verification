# AXI-memory-RTL-and-verification
Project on the verilog implementation of AXI lite Memory and its verification using Universal verification methodology in system verilog


AXI-Lite Slave (axilite_s)OverviewThis repository contains a Verilog implementation of a simple AXI-Lite Slave (memory-mapped) interface. This module acts as a peripheral accessible from an AXI Master (like a processor core), providing read and write access to an internal register array.The design utilizes a single Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage the transaction handshake sequences for both AXI write and AXI read operations, adhering strictly to the AXI-Lite protocol specifications (single data beat per transaction).FeatureStatusAXI StandardAXI4-LiteData Width32-bitMemory Size128 x 32-bit registers (512 Bytes)Clock DomainSingle Clock (s_axi_aclk)Write ResponseOKAY (2'b00) for valid addresses, SLVERR (2'b11) for out-of-bounds addresses.Read ResponseOKAY (2'b00) for valid addresses, SLVERR (2'b11) for out-of-bounds addresses.Internal Memory MapThe slave module incorporates a simple on-chip memory array for demonstration and functional testing.Address Range (32-bit offset)Description0x00 to 0x7FInternal Register Array (128 Registers): Read/Write accessible data.0x80 and aboveInvalid/Reserved: Access results in an SLVERR response.The memory is initialized to zero upon a synchronous reset (s_axi_aresetn = 0).AXI-Lite Write Operation FSMThe write transaction is managed by the FSM moving through the following states:idle: Waiting for a valid AW address or AR address.send_waddr_ack: The master asserts AWVALID. The slave accepts the address by asserting S_AXI_AWREADY and captures s_axi_awaddr into the waddr register. Transitions to wait for write data.send_wdata_ack: The master asserts WVALID. The slave accepts the data by asserting S_AXI_WREADY and captures s_axi_wdata into the wdata register.update_mem: The valid address/data pair is committed to the internal mem array.send_wr_resp: The slave asserts S_AXI_BVALID with an OKAY response (2'b00). Stays in this state until the master asserts BREADY.send_wr_err: If the address was invalid, the slave asserts S_AXI_BVALID with an SLVERR response (2'b11). Stays until BREADY is asserted.AXI-Lite Read Operation FSMThe read transaction follows a separate path in the FSM:idle: Waiting for a valid AR address or AW address.send_raddr_ack: The master asserts ARVALID. The slave accepts the address by asserting S_AXI_ARREADY and captures s_axi_araddr into the raddr register.gen_data: For valid addresses, the data is retrieved from mem[raddr] into the rdata register.Note: There is a short two-cycle delay (count < 2) inserted in the gen_data state before asserting RVALID, simulating latency typical in real hardware.send_rdata: The slave asserts S_AXI_RVALID with the data (s_axi_rdata) and an OKAY response (2'b00). Transitions back to idle upon receiving RREADY from the master.send_rd_err: If the address was invalid, the slave asserts S_AXI_RVALID with a zero payload and an SLVERR response (2'b11). Stays until RREADY is asserted.Port DefinitionsThe axilite_s module exposes the standard AXI4-Lite signals:Port NameDirectionWidthDescriptions_axi_aclkInput1System clocks_axi_aresetnInput1Active-low asynchronous resetWrite Address Channels_axi_awvalidInput1Write address valids_axi_awreadyOutput1Write address readys_axi_awaddrInput32Write addressWrite Data Channels_axi_wvalidInput1Write data valids_axi_wreadyOutput1Write data readys_axi_wdataInput32Write dataWrite Response Channels_axi_bvalidOutput1Write response valids_axi_breadyInput1Write response readys_axi_brespOutput2Write response (OKAY/SLVERR)Read Address Channels_axi_arvalidInput1Read address valids_axi_arreadyOutput1Read address readys_axi_araddrInput32Read addressRead Data Channels_axi_rvalidOutput1Read data valids_axi_rreadyInput1Read data readys_axi_rdataOutput32Read datas_axi_rrespOutput2Read response (OKAY/SLVERR)
